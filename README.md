# markovbot
A Python twitter bot that posts tweets generated by a Markov chain from given corpora.

The bot is built on top of tweepy. For any questions logging in, please refer to their documentation. If you
run the bot without adding this information, then it will run in "test" mode and simply print the output to the screen.

## Instructions
1) Add the desired text documents to the "main" method's documents variable (as a list). For an example, I included
the plots of several Star Wars movies, the opening crawls, several Star Trek movies, and Space Balls.

2) Fill out the twitter authorization information (consumer_key, consumer_secret (token), access_key, access_secret (token))
in the main method. This must be obtained through twitter. I recommend reading about Tweepy's authorization procedure.

3) Run "python bot.py" from the command prompt.
